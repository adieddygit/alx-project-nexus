🛒 ALX Project Nexus – E-commerce Progressive Web App
📌 Project Overview

ALX Project Nexus is a modern e-commerce Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed as part of the ProDev Frontend Engineering Program.
The project simulates a real-world production scenario where frontend engineers collaborate with backend developers to build a scalable, performant, and user-friendly web application.

This repository showcases not only the final product but also the engineering decisions, best practices, and architectural patterns applied throughout development.

🎓 About the ProDev Frontend Engineering Program

The ProDev Frontend Engineering Program is an intensive, hands-on training program designed to prepare engineers for real-world frontend roles.

The program emphasizes:

Modern frontend frameworks and tooling

Collaboration with backend engineers

Clean architecture and maintainable code

Performance, accessibility, and UX best practices
